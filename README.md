**awesome-logger** is an efficient logging tool designed for frontend developers, focusing on flexibility, extensibility, and developer experience. With built-in standardized log fields, a plugin-based architecture, and multi-dimensional log management, it helps developers quickly implement log collection, reporting, and analysis, improving application stability and troubleshooting efficiency.

## üåü Key Advantages

1. **Built-in standardized log fields for efficient troubleshooting**  
   Predefined key environment fields such as `os` (operating system), `device` (device model), and `ua` (user agent) allow comprehensive context collection without additional development, helping developers quickly pinpoint the root cause of issues.

2. **Flexible configuration of basic fields, supporting real-time query and analysis**  
   Users can customize basic fields (e.g., `uid`, `env`), which are automatically appended to each log. Combined with services like Alibaba Cloud SLS, this enables real-time log filtering and querying, accurately identifying user feedback scenarios.

3. **Multi-level log management for application health monitoring**  
   Supports multiple log levels such as `info`, `warn`, and `error`, helping developers build stability dashboards and monitor application health in real-time. Categorizing logs by level allows quick identification of potential risks and anomalies.

4. **Plugin-based architecture for seamless integration with any logging service**  
   With a plugin mechanism, developers can freely extend logging capabilities. Built-in support for major logging services like Alibaba Cloud SLS and Tencent Cloud CLS is provided, along with the ability to create custom plugins for private logging systems or other third-party services.

## üì¶ Architecture Design

awesome-logger adopts a layered architecture to ensure functional decoupling and extensibility:

1. **Core Layer (`@awesome-logger/core`)**  
   - **Logger Class**: Manages log generation, level control, and plugin registration. Provides methods like `info`, `warn`, and `error`, supporting basic field configuration.
   - **LogPlugin Abstract Class**: Defines plugin development specifications. All plugins must implement the `sendLog` method to send log data to the target service.

2. **Plugin Layer (`@awesome-logger/plugin-*`)**  
   Provides implementations for specific logging services. For example:
   - `@awesome-logger/plugin-sls`: Integrates with Alibaba Cloud SLS logging service.
   Developers can customize plugins according to specifications to extend logging capabilities.

3. **Usage Layer (`@awesome-logger/client`)**  
   - **Client Class**: Encapsulates core functionality to simplify user integration. Supports plugin registration via `usePlugin` and provides a unified logging interface.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @awesome-logger/client @awesome-logger/core @awesome-logger/plugin-sls
```

### 2. Initialization and Configuration
```typescript
import Client from '@awesome-logger/client';
import { Logger } from '@awesome-logger/core';
import { SLSLogPlugin } from '@awesome-logger/plugin-sls';

// create logger 
const logger = new Logger({
  uid: 'test_user_1',
  release: '1.0.0',
  env: 'production',
});

// you can also use logger.setBaseField function for some async scene
logger.setBaseField({ uid: 'user_001' });

// Configure basic fields
const client = new Client(logger);

// Register Alibaba Cloud SLS plugin
const slsPlugin = new SLSLogPlugin({
  endpoint: 'your-sls-endpoint',
  accessKeyId: 'your-access-key-id',
  accessKeySecret: 'your-access-key-secret',
  project: 'your-project',
  logstore: 'your-logstore'
});
client.usePlugin(slsPlugin);
```

### 3. Log Reporting
```typescript
// Report info log
client.info('enter_home_page', { page: 'home' });

// Report warning log
client.warn('api_timeout', { latency: 500 });

// Report error log
client.error('api_fail', { errorCode: 500, endpoint: '/api/data' });
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Custom Plugin Development

**awesome-logger** supports custom plugin development, enabling seamless integration with private logging systems or other services:

1. **Create a Plugin Class**
```typescript
import { LogPlugin } from '@awesome-logger/core';

class CustomLogPlugin extends LogPlugin {
  sendLog(logData: Record<string, any>) {
    // Custom log reporting logic
    console.log('Custom log service reporting:', logData);
    // Example: Send to a self-developed logging system
    fetch('https://your-log-service.com', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(logData)
    });
  }
}

export default CustomLogPlugin;
```

2. **Use the Custom Plugin**
```typescript
import Client from '@awesome-logger/client';
import CustomLogPlugin from './CustomLogPlugin';

const client = new Client();
const customPlugin = new CustomLogPlugin({ /* Custom configuration */ });
client.usePlugin(customPlugin);

client.info('This is a log reported by the custom plugin');
```
